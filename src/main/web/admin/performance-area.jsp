			before the tournament, or the first thing the day of the tournament.
			<ul>
				<li>When setting up the database you will be prompted to create
					a username and password. Pick something that isn't going to be
					obvious to those at the tournament and is easy to type into a
					tablet. This keeps non-officials from being able to change scores
					if they get onto the network that the server is on.</li>
				<li>If the database was already setup, make sure to get the
					username and password from the person that did the setup. If you
					cannot get this information, either run database setup or use the
					Create User link on the Admin Index from the server computer.</li>
