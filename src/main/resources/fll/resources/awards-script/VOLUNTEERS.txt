Before announcing the awards, I want to acknowledge the MANY people who have made this day and season possible:
- Our host school ${hostSchool} as well as

- ${tournamentDirectors} our Tournament Directors.

- Thank you to the teams, their parents and especially the coaches - they are the real heroes of the program, without them you would not be here. 

- A HUGE thank you to the event volunteers - judges, referees, computer folks and team volunteers - all who stepped forward to support this program and volunteered here today.

This year, we will be emailing the rubrics and judges' comments to the coach and the awards and participation medals have been given to coaches upon check-in will be sent via snail mail. 

Teams advancing to the ${tournamentNextLevel} tournament(s) will be announced at the end of the ceremony and an email will be sent to the coaches with more details about registration.
