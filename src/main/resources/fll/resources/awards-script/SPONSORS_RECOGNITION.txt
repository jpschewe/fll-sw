All of these organizations are recognized for providing substantial donations to High Tech Kids, without whom we could not bring you this event. We would also like to thank all of our corporate foundations & volunteer matching support as well as our many individual contributors. 
We appreciate their commitment to STEM in Minnesota and their recognition of this awesome program for kids. Letâ€™s give them a big hand.
