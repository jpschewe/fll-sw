Some things to note when creating a challenge description.

If you are going to use the tablet judging application, you will need to think about the text that you put in your rubric. 
Long words without spaces won't wrap in the interface. 
This makes the application very wide and may not be readable on the tablet. 
Using "application / solution" instead of "application/solution" allows the application to wrap between "application" and "/", thus making the interface fit on a smaller screen.
