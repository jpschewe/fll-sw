This folder contains training material.  There is a presentation used
for training in this folder and sample databases that are referenced
by the training in the `sample-databases` folder.  The 8 team
tournament is good for a basic understanding of the software. The 32
team tournament introduces multiple award groups. The state database
is good for seeing how multiple judging groups with a single award
group work as well as working with finalist scheduling.
