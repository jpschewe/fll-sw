# Subjective data entry

There are 2 ways to enter subjective scores, via a Java application and via a web application.

## Java Application

The Java application can be used on a desktop or laptop. 
This is useful when bulk entering scores.
For any scores that will be entered using this application the judges names need to be entered into the software before downloading the subjective data file.


Note that when the application comes up there will be a row for each judge per team in the same award group, regardless of if that judge is definitely scoring that team. 
This comes up when you have one award group with multiple judging groups. 
Normally this only happens at large tournaments, such as a state tournament.
When this happens there will be extra rows and you'll just have to watch closely to make sure all teams are scored properly. 
For instance if KH and KL are judging Programming for award group 1, each will only judge roughly half of the teams in award group 1.
However for each team there will be two rows, on for KH and one for KL. 
It's up to you to make sure scores are in the correct rows. 
There is a summary button that will tell you how many scores have been entered for each team in a category. 
By looking at this you can quickly tell which scores haven't been entered or if a score has been entered for the wrong team.


  1. Download the subjective data file from the server.
    * This is a link on the admin index
  1. Start the subjective app
    * It can be launched from the main launcher application
    * It is included in the install or can be downloaded from the main index or the admin index
  1. Select the file that was downloaded
    * The file should be `subjective-data.fll`, but may have `.zip` at the end instead.
  1. Select the tab for the category that you are entering
  1. Find the row for the team and judge that you have a score sheet for
  1. Enter the scores
  1. Carefully check the accuracy of the entered scores, either via double checking the values you typed in, or by confirming that the total computed score matches the manually computed score.

## Web Application

The web application can be used on a desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet. Although a phone screen might be a little small to be useful. Judges names do not need to be entered before using the subjective web application. This application is accessible from the main index and from the admin index. The app is intended to be self explanatory as the user is guided through the judging.

We have found that the Silk browser on Amazon tablets sometimes has problems working offline properly. 
It is best if one can load Chrome on these tablets and use that browser instead. 

# Checking entered scores

Once scores have been uploaded from the tablets or via the Java application it is a good idea to check that all scores are entered. 
One way to do this is to download the subjective data file and open it up in the subjective Java application and see that all of the expected scores appear.
The other way to check is to visit the subjective web application from the server and check the scores there.
