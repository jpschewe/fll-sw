 
I actually think including end-of-round delays:
16 or 15 teams 50 minutes
14 or 13 teams 45 minutes
12 or 11 teams 40 minutes
10 or  9 teams 35 minutes
8  teams 30 minutes
 
some examples below –
 
16 teams - 2 double tables (total of 15 matches)
 
                8 first round matches
                4xtimes (20 minutes)
scoring completed enough to do next round immediately
                4 second round matches
                2xtimes (10 minutes)
scoring of second set not completed - 5 minute delay
                2 third round matches
                1xtimes (5 minutes)
scoring of third round not completed - 5 minute delay
                1 final match (5 minutes)
 
11 team – 2 double tables (total of 10 matches)
                3 first round matches (5 teams had byes)
                2xtimes  (10 minutes)
(and could do a single second round match in this time,
                but that creates odd number and doesn’t save overall time)
scoring completed enough to do next round immediately
                4 second round matches
                2xtimes (10 minutes)
scoring of second set not completed - 5 minute delay
                2 third round matches
                1xtimes (5 minutes)
scoring of third round not completed - 5 minute delay
                1 final match (5 minutes)
 
10 teams – 2 double tables (total of 9 matches)
                2 first round matches (8/9 and 7/10, 6 teams had byes)
                1xtime  (5 minutes)
                2 second round matches can go (3/6 and 4/5) no delay
                1xtime (5 minutes)
                2 second round matches can go (1/8-9 and 2/7-10) no delay
                1xtime (5 minutes)
scoring  not completed - 5 minute delay
                2 third round matches
                1xtimes (5 minutes)
scoring of third round not completed - 5 minute delay
                1 final match (5 minutes)
