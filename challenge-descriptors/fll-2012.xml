  <!-- On the Challenge's image of the Pointer Position, it shows major and 
   minor portions. The major portions are indicated by a physical LEGO light, 
   while the minor portions are just evenly split. The Challenge just provided 
   a chart keying major and minor ticks to scores, but that would be far too 
   lengthy to transpose. If we look at the pattern of the score changes from 
   tick to tick (1 increment = 1 tick), we can see it first increments by five 
   points each time, then by three, then by one point. I divided these up into 
   progression scales. "Progression" is the total number of ticks from the bottom 
   of the chart, leaving the default progression amount at 12 ticks. Progression 
   scales: - Scale 1: Increment by 5 points, goes from progression 0 to progression 
   24 - Scale 2: Increment by 3 points, goes from progression 25 to progression 
   36 - Note: There is a 10 point bonus added at the jump from 6-0 to 6-1. - 
   Scale 3: Increment by 1 points, ranges from progression 37 until progression 
   48 To calculate a score based off of a major and minor tick, the following 
   thought process occurs: - Compute total progression from the very bottom 
   of the entire scale. - Does it fit into scale 1? Compute and go. Add -60 
   point offset. - Does it fit into scale 2? - If so, we must first account 
   for the minimum number of points one could recieve purely based off of the 
   fact we're in scale 2. This number is 120 points. (progression 24) Next, 
   we can use a coefficient to calculate the number of points to be added in 
   in scale 2. The same happens for scale 3, and the subset of scale 2 with 
   the 10 point bonus. -->
