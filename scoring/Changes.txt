2003-09-20  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	scriptlets.

	it in all of the body tags (707854).

	* src/fll/gui/SubjectiveFrame.java: Display title attribute rather
	than name attribute from subjective categories, also changed in
	the report generation classes (707873).

	category element (707873).

	computer.  This page opens up a new window in fullscreen mode
	(Mozilla users may need to press F11) and then displays the
	welcome page, the scoreboard or the remotely controlled brackets.
	This page is controlled via a remote control page accessible from
	the admin page.  Also the scoreboard pages now automatically

	appropriate page. (707891, 707856).

	Put "No Score" in bold red on final score report for missing
	scores.  (707890)

	* docs/README.developer (MISC): Removed the application variable
	currentTournament, just use Queries.getCurrentTournament() all of

	* web/playoff/adminbrackets.jsp: Reworked to always recompute the
	teams and allow the run number to advance to to be passed in as a

	* web/report/summarizePhase1.jsp: Modified query to group by

	* scripts/convertTournaments.sql: SQL script to convert databases
	from last season to add support for heirarchial tournaments and to
