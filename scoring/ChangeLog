	* src/fll/Queries.java (getColorForDivisionIndex): Support
	coloring more than just 2 divisions (766208).

	that has a nice GUI (707892).

	* web/scoreEntry/select_team.jsp: Moved edit widgets around a bit
	to make it more obvious that the checkbox and dropdown are tied
	together (707865).

	This also caused the web pages to be updated to properly reference
	the challenge title, I was just getting lucky that it was the
	first title attribute in the document.

2003-09-20  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/web/report/FinalComputedScores.java (generateReport):

	in favor of using standard form parameters and server side
	checking (707895).

2003-09-07  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* web/scoreboard/top10.jsp: Now the top10 page uses session
	variables instead of form parameters to keep track of which
	division is being displayed.  This should keep the browsers
	history from filling up with urls (707896).

	* web/index.jsp: Figured out how to use the JSTL XML tags to get
	information out of challengeDocument to remove some more
	scriptlets.

2003-09-06  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* web/report/teamPerformanceReport.jsp: Added a report that
	contains the performance scores for a team by run number (707861).

2003-08-25  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* web/style/style.jsp: Started on using stylesheets everywhere.
	Use a jsp file as a stylesheet so that parameters such as images
	can be done via JSTL.  In this case make sure that all files use
	the appropriate background image and color without having to put
	it in all of the body tags (707854).

	* src/fll/gui/SubjectiveFrame.java: Display title attribute rather
	than name attribute from subjective categories, also changed in
	the report generation classes (707873).

	* src/resources/fll.xsd: Added title attribute to subjective
	category element (707873).

2003-08-16  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* Multiple files: Added display page the is used for the display
	computer.  This page opens up a new window in fullscreen mode
	(Mozilla users may need to press F11) and then displays the
	welcome page, the scoreboard or the remotely controlled brackets.
	This page is controlled via a remote control page accessible from
	the admin page.  Also the scoreboard pages now automatically
	detect the screen size and redirect the web browser to the
	appropriate page. (707891, 707856).
	
	* web/WEB-INF/jspf/initializeApplicationVars.jspf: Added cache
	control headers.  This should keep all pages from being cached in

	Put "No Score" in bold red on final score report for missing
	scores.  (707890)

	* docs/README.developer (MISC): Removed the application variable
	currentTournament, just use Queries.getCurrentTournament() all of
	the time now.

	* web/admin/index.jsp: Make sure we don't grab the current
	tournament until after it's actually been changed, otherwise the
	combobox reports the previous tournament after changes.

	* src/fll/web/GetFile.java (getFile): Ensure that
	judges are assigned before downloading subjective datafile (707847).

	* src/fll/Queries.java (isJudgesProperlyAssigned): Ensure that
	judges are assigned before downloading subjective datafile (707847).

2003-08-09  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/model/SubjectiveTableModel.java (sort): Use
	fireTableDataChanged to signify that a sort has occurred instead

	getting recreated and loosing the editor. (707840)  

2003-07-27  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/web/GetFile.java (getFile): Make score.xml human
	readable (707855).

2003-07-25  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/gui/SubjectiveFrame.java (SubjectiveFrame): Gave each
	category it's own table and put them in a tabbed pane.  This makes
	sure that a table doesn't loose it's size and sort settings when
	switching categories. (707885)

2003-07-21  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/web/playoff/Playoff.java (insertBye): 
	Always use the tournament from the database. (707887)

	* src/fll/ScoreStandardization.java (setSubjectiveScoreGroups):
	Always use the tournament from the database. (707887)

2003-07-20  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* web/playoff/remoteControlBrackets.jsp: Reworked to always
	recompute the teams and don't use session variables.  This makes
	sure we don't have caching problems. (707839)

	* web/playoff/adminbrackets.jsp: Reworked to always recompute the
	teams and allow the run number to advance to to be passed in as a
	parameter.  This should fix the problems with refresh and
	advancement of rounds. (707838)

2003-07-19  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* web/report/summarizePhase1.jsp: Modified query to group by
	ScoreGroup and Category.  (707841)

	* src/fll/xml/GenerateDB.java (generateDB): Make division a string
	rather than a number (707893)

	* build.xml: the compile.jsp task is broken again, so I've taken
	it out of the build.  Gonna have to fix it again later.

	* web/admin/editTeam.jsp: Added support for moving teams from one
	tournament to the next (707876).  
	Continued cleanup by adding JSTL tags.

	* scripts/convertTournaments.sql:  I think I've got all of the
	table changes in now for hierarchial tournaments (707876), along
	with some cleanups to table fields.

	* src/fll/xml/GenerateDB.java (generateDB): More work on
	hierarchial tournaments (707876).  Cleaned up the tables by
	removing extra columns that aren't used.

2003-04-24  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/gui/SubjectiveFrame.java (SubjectiveFrame): When
	switching score categories, make sure to tell the table to stop
	editing a cell, if it is.  This keeps one from losing data when
	switching categories without first tabing to another cell.
	(707852)

2003-04-22  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* src/fll/web/admin/Tournaments.java (verifyData): Allow one to
	specify the next tournament and do validation on the data input
	before committing it to the database.

	* build.xml: Force overwrite of web.xml when copying to ensure the
	correct one is always deployed.  Cleaned up javadoc target.

2003-04-20  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* scripts/convertTournaments.sql: SQL script to convert databases
	from last season to add support for heirarchial tournaments and to
	be consistent about region/tournament naming.  This should allow
	us to use last season's databases for test data.  (707874, 707876)

	* web/admin/editTeam.jsp: Allow the current tournament as well as
	the entry tournament to be edited to support heirarchial
	tournaments.  (707876)

	* src/fll/web/admin/Tournaments.java (commitData): Don't delete
	all of the tournament data when updating information.  Just update

	* build.xml: Upgraded log4j from 1.2.6 to 1.2.8.

	* src/fll/xml/GenerateDB.java (generateDB): Removed fll_admin as a
	database user.  Just use fll as hte only database user with full
	privileges.  At this point I can't come up with a good reason for
	having two different database users. (707870)

2003-04-04  Jon Schewe  <jpschewe@mtu.net>

	* docs/README.developer: Added information about JSTL

	* web/scoreboard_800/main.jsp: Merged common pieces of code
	between the 800x600 scoreboard and the 1024x768 scoreboard.  

	* build.xml: (707867) Added a direct Java call to JspC using the
	-webapp option.  This handles directories correctly, however

	each time.

	* web/scoreboard/allteams.jsp: Started working on using JSTL in
