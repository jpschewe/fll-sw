ANT Tasks for Perforce integration.

These tasks provide basic P4 capabilities to automated ANT-based build systems. <b>Note:</b>
the tasks in this package are linked against the Jakarta ORO 2.0 library which
brings the power of Perl 5 regular expressions to Java.

These tasks also require you to have the p4 (or p4.exe) client in your path.
