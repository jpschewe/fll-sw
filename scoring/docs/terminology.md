Grouping Teams
==============

There are a number of different ways that teams are grouped in the software. 
This describes the different groups and what they mean.

Event Division
--------------

At each tournament a team is put into an event division.
An event division is a group of teams that are competing against each other.
There are one set of awards for each event division.
Teams in different event divisions may compete on opposite sides of the performance table from each other during the seeding rounds.
This is OK because teams are just going for the best score at this point and not really competing against the team on the other side of the table.

Judging Group
-------------

Each team is assigned to a judging group for subjective judging.
This defined which judge they will see for the subjective scoring categories.
At smaller tournaments where 1 judge has enough time to see all tabs in an event division, the judging station is effectively the same as the event division; and in many cases the names are the same.

At larger tournaments the teams in an event division are split up into multiple judging groups.
Then the top teams in a subjective category across all judging groups in an event division are judged again by a select group of judges to determine a winner.
This second level of judging is needed to choose the best team in an event division because the scoring is subjective and a 10 for over judge doesn't mean the same thing as a 10 from another judge.
So the best we can do is choose the best team from each judge and see them again.

Finalist judging is scheduled per event division. This is because as there is a winner in each event division and the finalist judging for multiple event divisions can occur at the same time.

Playoff Division
----------------

When the payoff brackets are used playoff divisions after created to group there teams that will compete against reach other in the playoff bracket.
In most cases the playoff divisions map directly to event divisions.
However at some large tournaments where there is finalist judging an event division will many times be split into two or more playoff divisions.
These teams will then compete and determine a winner or possibly the top 4 teams.
Then the top teams or teams in each playoff division will compete in another playoff bracket to determine the event division wonder of the playoffs.

Score Categories
================

There are 2 ties of scoring categories.
Performance and subjective.
Categories are made up of missions.
*eventually they will be made up of areas and areas will contain missions.*
All scores for the missions in a category are added together to determine the raw score for a category.
Each category had a weight that determines how much that score contributes to a team's overall score.
This weight is multiplied by the scaled score for a category and then summed to determine there overall score.
See [score normalization](ScoreExplaination.pdf) for details on how raw scores become scaled scores.


Performance
-----------

There is currently only one performance category at each tournament.
Performance scoring is objective.
All of the missions have a set of rules to determine what score a team gets for the mission.

Subjective
----------

There can be unlimited subjective categories.
Missions in a subjective category are scored within a range by a judge.
Each judge may use different parts of the range and therefore may come up with a different score for the same team than another judge.
For this reason to determine there winner in a subjective category a single judge must see all teams in an event division or finalist judging must be used.

Playoffs
========

Playoffs are a single elimination competition bracket.
Sometimes referred to as head to head.
Teams after seeded into the bracket based on since criteria, usually this is based on the scores from the seeding rounds.
A team then completes against the team across the table from them.
The team with the best score contributes on.
