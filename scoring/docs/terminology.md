Grouping Teams
==============

There are a number of different ways that teams are grouped in the software. 
This describes the different groups and what they mean.

Award Group
--------------

At each tournament a team is put into an award group.
An award group is a group of teams that are competing against each other.
There are one set of awards for each award group.
Teams in different award groups may compete on opposite sides of the performance table from each other during the seeding rounds.
This is OK because teams are just going for the best score at this point and not really competing against the team on the other side of the table.

Judging Group
-------------

Each team is assigned to a judging group for subjective judging.
This defines which set of judges they will see for the subjective scoring categories.
At smaller tournaments where 1 set of judges has enough time to see all teams in an award group, the judging group is the same as the award group.

At larger tournaments, the teams in an award group are split up into multiple judging groups.
A second level of judging is needed to choose the best team in an award group because the scores from one judging group may not correlate to scores from another judging group.
So the best we can do is choose the best team from each judging group and see them again.
The top team in each judging group in each subjective category is judged again by a select group of judges to choose the winner in an award group for a category.


Score Categories
================

There are 2 types of scoring categories.
Performance and subjective.
Categories are made up of goals.
All scores for the goals in a category are added together to determine the raw score for a category.
Each category had a weight that determines how much that score contributes to a team's overall score.
This weight is multiplied by the scaled score for a category and then summed to determine there overall score.
See [score normalization](ScoreExplaination.pdf) for details on how raw scores become scaled scores.


Performance
-----------

There is currently only one performance category at each tournament.
Performance scoring is objective.
All of the goals have a set of rules to determine what score a team gets for the goal.

Subjective
----------

This is sometimes referred to as judging scores.
There can be unlimited subjective categories.
Goals in a subjective category are scored within a range by a judge.
Each judge may use different parts of the range and therefore may come up with a different score for the same team than another judge.
For this reason, to determine the winner in a subjective category a single judge must see all teams in an award group or finalist judging must be used.

Playoffs
========

Playoffs are a single elimination competition bracket.
Sometimes referred to as head to head.
Teams after seeded into the bracket based on some criteria, usually this is based on the scores from the seeding rounds.
A team then completes against the team across the table from them.
The team with the best score contributes on.

[Wikipedia article on single elimination tournaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament)
for more information.

Playoff Brackets
----------------

Playoff brackets are an optional part of a tournament.

Each playoff bracket contains a group of teams that will compete against each other to determine a playoff winner.
In most cases, a playoff bracket correlates directly to an award group.
However at some large tournaments where finalist judging is used an award group may be split into two or more playoff brackets.
These teams will then compete and determine a winner.
Then the top teams or teams in each playoff bracket will compete in another playoff bracket to determine the award group winner of the playoffs.
