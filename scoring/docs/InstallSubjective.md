Installing the subjective application
======================================

The subjective score entry software is used to enter subjective scores. The install is fairly simple.

  1. [Install the server software](InstallServerSoftware) on your server
  1. In the directory that you installed the software enter the directory `bin`
  1. Copy all files that start with `subjective` to the computer that you will run the subjective software on
    * If the server is where you will enter subjective scores, then there is nothing to do, you can run the software from right here
