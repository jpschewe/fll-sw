# Subjective data entry

There are 2 ways to enter subjective scores, via a Java application and via a web application.

## Java Application

The Java application can be used on a desktop or laptop. 
This is useful when bulk entering scores.
For any scores that will be entered using this application the judges names need to be entered into the software before downloading the subjective data file.


Note that when the application comes up there will be a row for each judge per team in the same award group, regardless of if that judge is definitely scoring that team. 
This comes up when you have one award group with multiple judging groups. 
Normally this only happens at large tournaments, such as a state tournament.
When this happens there will be extra rows and you'll just have to watch closely to make sure all teams are scored properly. 
For instance if KH and KL are judging Programming for award group 1, each will only judge roughly half of the teams in award group 1.
However for each team there will be two rows, on for KH and one for KL. 
It's up to you to make sure scores are in the correct rows. 
There is a summary button that will tell you how many scores have been entered for each team in a category. 
By looking at this you can quickly tell which scores haven't been entered or if a score has been entered for the wrong team.

## Web Application

The web application can be used on a desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet. Although a phone screen might be a little small to be useful. Judges names do not need to be entered before using the subjective web application.
