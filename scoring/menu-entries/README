This directory contains directory structure to create an FLL-SW menu in
Gnome and KDE and to add the applications to the XFCE menu under "Other".
To install:

1) Edit the desktop files in local/share/applications/fll-sw and replace
"/home/flluser/fll-sw" with the path to the directory that you
installed the software into.

2) Copy all files and from config into ~/.config

3) Copy all files and directories from local into ~/.local

The directories ~/.config and ~/.local should already exist, so you'll just
be copying files into these directories. You can do this with:
rsync -rv config/ ~/.config
rsync -rv local/ ~/.local
